### Q: It looks like my character is trapped in an area from which there is no exit! I'm stuck! ###

A: That's intentional: not all areas of the dungeon are connected. You need to use a pickaxe (you start the game with one), explosives or magic items to dig yourself out.

'_a_'pply the pickaxe to dig into walls.

### Q: I tried killing a monster and failed! How come my character is so weak? Do I need to find a special item for combat? ###

A: The game is biased toward level: almost any monster of a level higher than your own is difficult, no matter what weapon you use.

That said, different weapons have different drawbacks. Usually, less powerful weapons have more range or carry more ammo.

### Q: I picked up a weapon but I can't fire it! ###

A: Every weapon has a minimum and maximum range. The interface will not allow you to fire at something that isn't within rage. (That includes walls and empty space, not just monsters.)

This is especially important with the RPG laucher, since firing at something below range will blow up the player character as well.

### Q: How can I heal my character? ###

A: At present, only by finding and applying a healing pill/remedy.

### Q: How can I regain sleep/rest? ###

A: Use the '_s_' and '_r_' keys, respectively. Note that your character can sleep only if your sleep stat is low enough to permit it.

### Q: How can a regain warmth? ###

A: By consuming booze or wearing specialized clothes. There also exist special dungeon features that radiate warmth.

### Q: I died of thirst! How do I drink? ###

A: Stand at a puddle of water and press '_q_'. Note that there are no items in the game which are drinkable.

### Q: How do I win the game? ###

A: The number of monsters in the dungeon is limited. Kill them all to win.
