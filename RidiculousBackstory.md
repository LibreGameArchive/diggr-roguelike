The year is 2150 A.D.

You, a self-respecting hacker, are in a hospital intensive care unit.
Due to a particularly gruesome hoverboard
accident, you are now stuck to a life-support machine

While you are unconscious, a malevolent rogue artificial intelligence by the
name of Summerscream infiltrates your onboard computer via a security hole
in the Twitter API of your lung ventilation machine.
Taking advantage of your incapacitated state, Summerscream downloads your
digital snapshot.

Stuck in the barren wastes of Summerscream's memory banks, your
avatar is now face-to-face with the hordes of Summerscream's ego
manifestations.

Summerscream, armed with its impressive knowledge of arcane 20th-century lore,
has trapped you in an infinite cycle of reincarnations.

The only way to escape is to destroy every single one of the horrific
apparitions Summerscream throws at you, leaving it temporarily incapacitated
while you hack yourself out of this prison.

Good luck.
