**NOTE:**  Diggr's not dead, it's just resting.

_Check out [Infinite Cave Adventure](http://dungeon.name) instead, the awesome successor to Diggr._

An experiment at creating a new and fresh roguelike, called **Diggr**. What makes **diggr** different:

  * **Diggr** attempts to make _impossible_ all forms of scumming. (A first in the roguelike world, I believe. :))

  * **Diggr** is not at all based on AD&D in any way. All game mechanics are invented from scratch, keeping strictly in mind this list of requirements!

  * **Diggr** should play fast. Hours and hours of boring bouts of hacking and slashing are not welcome here!

  * **Diggr** attempts to continue the in the strategic gameplay style of Nethack. (Nethack is the best video game evar.) Like Nethack, **diggr** should be a complex, evil game with a steep  learning curve. Roguelikes that play themselves on autopilot are not fun!

  * **Diggr** should have a sense of humor. **Diggr** should also avoid common fantasy tropes and cliches.

  * **Diggr** avoids 'flavor' for flavor's sake. All items and monsters should have a different and unique impact on gameplay, and not be just renamed clones of effectively the same monster and item.

  * (This one is controversial) Spoilers are fun. A game that needs 'spoilers' is a game that has depth. **Diggr** should be a game where the mechanics and strategies are not obvious and low-hanging fruit.

See [Guide](Guide.md) for some more details, and an [FAQ](Faq.md). (Also, the [alphabet soup and monster field guide](MonsterGuide.md).)

Like any self-respecting roguelike, Diggr also has a [Sufficiently Ridiculous Backstory](RidiculousBackstory.md).

See [here](RunningFromSource.md) for information on running the game from source code. I've provided Windows and Linux packages. Macs should be supported, too, but your only option at the moment is running from the source code.
